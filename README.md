# NLine tester scripts
Scripts for testing NLines also called Newcamd in C# and Python

With them you can program your own testing website/software and be sure that nobody is stealing your lines :)

Code that helped me to do it:

1- NFProxy v0.1.2: http://ftabeta.com/showthread.php?t=48943&p=278919&viewfull=1#post278919
The code of this program is obfuscated but with de4dot you can see what's going on inside ;)

2- Oscam: https://github.com/gfto/oscam/blob/master/module-newcamd.c

3- NewBox: https://github.com/javilonas/NewBox/blob/master/cli-newcamd.c

4- Code in Java of CSP: https://code.google.com/archive/p/3color/source/default/source
and http://www.infosat.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=13

5- This documentation (although is outdated): https://3color.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cardservproxy/etc/protocol.txt

Check this repository for a Cline (CCcam) tester: https://github.com/DaggerES/CLineTester

Please, share your code!!!!
