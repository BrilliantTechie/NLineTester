# NLine tester scripts
Scripts for testing NLines also called Newcamd in C# and Java

Currently they don't work, so any help is appreciated

CSharp code is based on this documentation: https://3color.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cardservproxy/etc/protocol.txt

Java is based on the CSP source code:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/3color/source/default/source
and http://www.infosat.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=13

Code that may help to finish it:

2- Oscam: https://github.com/gfto/oscam/blob/master/module-newcamd.c

3- NewBox: https://github.com/javilonas/NewBox/blob/master/cli-newcamd.c

4- Twinprot: https://github.com/TELE-SHARE/Twinprot
